# LangChain Example

This is a minimal example showing how to wrap `skill_tool` as a LangChain tool and call it,
including a simple agent run with Qwen-Max (DashScope).

## Usage

```bash
python3 example.py
```

## Notes

- Update `SKILLS_ROOT` if your skills live elsewhere.
- Set `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` in your environment.
- Install deps: `pip install langchain langchain-community`.
