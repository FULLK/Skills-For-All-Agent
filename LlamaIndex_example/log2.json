Use when analyzing C programs, understanding code structure, performing static analysis, or preparing code for further program analysis (e.g., CFG, DFG, vulnerability detection).\n---\n\n# C to AST Skill\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis Skill converts **C source code** into its **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** representation.\n\nUse this Skill when you need to:\n- Understand the structure of a C program\n- Analyze functions, statements, and expressions\n- Prepare C code for static analysis or security analysis\n- Transform C code into an intermediate representation (AST)\n- Feed structured code information into downstream tools or agents\n\nThe AST is generated using a Python-based C parser and printed directly to standard output.\n\n---\n\n## When to Use\n\nApply this Skill when the user asks to:\n- “Parse this C code”\n- “Convert this C file to an AST”\n- “Show me the AST of this C program”\n- “Analyze the structure of this C code”\n- “Extract syntax tree / abstract syntax tree from C”\n\nThis Skill is especially useful in **compiler frontends**, **program analysis**, and **security research** workflows.\n\n---\n\n## Instructions\n\nFollow these steps strictly and in order:\n\n1. **Navigate to the Skill scripts directory**\n   - Change working directory to:\n     ```\n     skills_for_all_agent/skill/c_2_ast/scripts/\n     ```\n\n2. **Handle the input C source**\n   - If the user provides a **path to a `.c` file**, use it directly.\n   - If the user provides **inline C code as a string**, you must first save it to a C source file using the provided script:\n     ```bash\n     python3 save_c.py --input \"<C code string>\" --output <output_dir> --filename <filename>.c\n     ```\n   - Ensure the generated file has a `.c` extension and is successfully written to disk.\n\n3. **Run the AST extraction script**\n   - Convert the C source file to its Abstract Syntax Tree by executing:\n     ```bash\n     python3 c_2_ast.py --input <path_to_c_file>\n     ```\n\n4. **Do not modify the source code**\n   - This Skill is strictly read-only.\n   - Do not rewrite, reformat, optimize, or otherwise alter the C code.\n\n5. **Return the AST output verbatim**\n   - The script prints the AST directly to standard output.\n   - Return the output exactly as produced.\n   - Do not summarize, paraphrase, or restructure the AST.\n   - Preserve indentation, hierarchy, and node ordering.\n\n6. **If parsing fails**\n   - Report the exact error message produced by the script.\n   - Suggest likely causes, such as:\n     - Missing or unsupported header files\n     - Unsupported C extensions (e.g., compiler-specific syntax)\n     - Invalid or incomplete C syntax\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nThe output is a **tree-structured textual AST**, for example:\n\n````\n\nFileAST:\nFuncDef:\nDecl: main\nFuncDecl:\nTypeDecl:\nIdentifierType: ['int']\nCompound:\nFuncCall:\nID: puts\nExprList:\nConstant: string, \"Hello\"\nReturn:\nConstant: int, 0\n\n````\n\nThis output represents the syntactic structure of the C program and can be consumed by downstream tools.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nFor deeper understanding of:\n- AST node types\n- `pycparser` internal representation\n- Meaning of specific syntax tree nodes\n- Limitations of the C grammar supported\n\nsee the accompanying reference document:\n\n➡️ **[reference.md](reference.md)**\n\nOnly read this file **when more detailed or theoretical information is required**.  \nFor standard AST extraction tasks, this Skill file alone is sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## Notes and Limitations\n\n- The AST follows standard C syntax (C89/C99 subset).\n- Some compiler-specific extensions (e.g., GCC attributes) may not be supported.\n- Header files are handled using a minimal fake libc environment.\n- Macro-heavy or highly platform-specific code may require preprocessing.\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Simple AST extraction\n\nUser request:\n> Convert this C file to an AST.\n\nAction:\n```bash\npython3 c_2_AST.py --input example.c\n````\n\nResult:\n\n* The AST is printed directly.\n\n---\n\n### Example 2: Security analysis preparation\n\nUser request:\n\n> I want to analyze this C program for vulnerabilities.\n\nAction:\n\n* First, extract the AST using this Skill.\n* Then, pass the AST to a vulnerability analysis or pattern-matching process.\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices\n\n* Use this Skill **before** any deep code analysis.\n* Treat the AST as an intermediate representation.\n* Combine with CFG/DFG or semantic analysis for advanced tasks.\n\n---\n\nEnd of Skill.\n"
