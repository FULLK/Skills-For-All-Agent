以下是将您提供的 C 代码转换为抽象语法树（AST）的结果：

```
FileAST: 
  Typedef: FILE, [], ['typedef']
    TypeDecl: FILE, [], None
      IdentifierType: ['int']
  Decl: printf, [], [], [], []
    FuncDecl: 
      ParamList: 
        Decl: fmt, ['const'], [], [], []
          PtrDecl: []
            TypeDecl: fmt, ['const'], None
              IdentifierType: ['char']
        EllipsisParam: 
      TypeDecl: printf, [], None
        IdentifierType: ['int']
  Decl: puts, [], [], [], []
    FuncDecl: 
      ParamList: 
        Decl: s, ['const'], [], [], []
          PtrDecl: []
            TypeDecl: s, ['const'], None
              IdentifierType: ['char']
      TypeDecl: puts, [], None
        IdentifierType: ['int']
  FuncDef: 
    Decl: main, [], [], [], []
      FuncDecl: 
        TypeDecl: main, [], None
          IdentifierType: ['int']
    Compound: 
      FuncCall: 
        ID: puts
        ExprList: 
          Constant: string, "Generated by agent"
      Return: 
        Constant: int, 0
```

该 AST 展示了代码的结构，包括：
- 文件级别的声明（如 `FILE` 类型定义、`printf` 和 `puts` 函数声明）
- `main` 函数的定义
- `main` 函数体内的语句：调用 `puts` 函数并返回 0

这是标准的树形结构表示，可用于进一步的程序分析或处理。
